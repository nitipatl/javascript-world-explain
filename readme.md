- Late 2010, several competing JavaScript package managers emerged to help automate the process of downloading and upgrading libraries from a central repository

- 2013, [Bower](https://bower.io/)

- 2015, [npm](http://npmjs.com/) is popular, was originally a package manager made specifically for node.js, (run on the server, not the frontend).

- Late 2016, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) from Facebook engineer.

## Yarn VS npm

- package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json (npm 5+ too).


## npm

`npm init`

package.json created from that step.

`npm install moment --save`

node_modules created, package.json updated.
